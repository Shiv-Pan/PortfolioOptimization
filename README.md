# üìà Investment Performance & Risk Analysis ‚Äì 2nd Individual Assignment

**Course:** Investments / Financial Management (Spring 2025)  
**Institution:** San Jos√© State University  
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel, Historical Data Modeling

## Overview
This project involved analyzing the historical monthly price performance of three investment assets‚ÄîGVA (Granite Construction), SONY (Sony Corporation), and USRT (a Real Estate ETF)‚Äîover a multi-year period. The purpose of the assignment was to compute returns, assess risk, and evaluate performance using financial metrics such as expected return, variance, standard deviation, and correlation. The data was modeled in Excel using both raw historical prices and calculated returns to inform hypothetical portfolio analysis.

## üîç Key Deliverables
- **Monthly Return Calculations:** Computed asset returns based on historical closing prices using both discrete and logarithmic return formulas.
- **Excess Return Evaluation:** Compared monthly asset returns to a market benchmark to assess outperformance and consistency.
- **Risk Metrics:** Calculated variance, standard deviation, and beta for each asset to evaluate volatility and systematic risk.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Assessed inter-asset relationships using covariance and correlation to identify diversification opportunities.
- **Performance Interpretation:** Developed a summary of each asset‚Äôs return behavior and volatility over the observed period, offering commentary on portfolio implications.

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of time-series return modeling in Excel.
- Applied core concepts from portfolio theory to real-world financial data.
- Gained experience with statistical tools to analyze asset-level performance, correlation, and volatility.
