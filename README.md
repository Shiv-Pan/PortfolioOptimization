In this project, I conducted a portfolio optimization analysis using three securities: GVA, SONY, and USRT. I gathered monthly historical price data to calculate the returns for each asset and then used those returns to determine key statistics such as expected returns, standard deviations, and covariances.
My main goal was to build an efficient portfolioâ€”either by maximizing expected returns for a given level of risk or by minimizing risk for a target return. I applied principles from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), using mean-variance optimization techniques to evaluate different combinations of asset weights.
To assess the effectiveness of each portfolio, I calculated performance metrics like the Sharpe ratio, which helped me identify the most efficient allocation based on risk-adjusted returns. This analysis gave me a deeper understanding of the risk-return trade-off and allowed me to explore investment strategies that align with different investor preferences.
